## About

This is my third project at the Udacity Nanodegree Frontend Web Development program. The game is about a player who tries to avoid been hit by an enemy bug while navigating through a canvas to a place of safety.

## How to Run

To run this application, download or clone the zip file from this repository to your computer and then click on the index.html file to open the game in your browser. Alternatively, you can click on the link in the **Link to Live page** section below to play.

## How to Play

* Use your keyboard arrow keys(left/right/up/dowm) to navigate the canvas to the water block(topmost block) while avoiding been hit by an enemy.
* If you are hit by an enemy, the game returns you to the initial start position.
* When you get to the water block, the game returns you to the initial start position and increases the game level and the difficulty.      This continues until you get to the final level(6) afterwhich a congratulatory modal is output.
* To play again, click on the close icon or the play again button

## Dependencies

The game was built using Object-Oriented Javascript and the player and enemy classes were created using ES6.
